I created the Neverhome discord bot so that it would protect the community and help with repetitive tasks that the moderators would be doing. 
Currently, the bot is capable of:
- Ban waves
- Ban waves on both Roblox *AND* Discord
- Normal bans for both Roblox *AND* Discord.
- Verification checks that automatically inform the community if they aren't verified with the latest system.
